# Post/Comment-Based Website
This website was created by a team of Computer Science students at FAU for a project in CEN 4010: Principles of Software Engineering. The purpose of this project was to create a website for fau students looking for help with programming concepts. The structure of this project takes a basic post and comment approach. A user can login with either an email and password or a google account. Each account has its own settings and preferences that can be edited in real time. The base of the website is the home screen where all the posts and comments are displayed. A user is able to type out their own post and comment on others while also being able to sort the posts by programming languages. The programming languages we support for help include C, C++, C#, Python and Java.

This project was created with the Angular Framwork for the front-end and Google Firebase Firestore for the back-end.
